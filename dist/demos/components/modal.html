  <h1>A11y Dialog</h1>

  <p>This page demonstrates how to make a dialog window as accessible as possible to assistive technology users. Dialog windows are especially problematic for screen reader users. Often times the user is able to “escape” the window and interact with other parts of the page when they should not be able to. This is partially due to the way screen reader software interacts with the browser.</p>

</header>

  <section class="content">
      <button type="button"  data-a11y-dialog-show="my-accessible-dialog">
          Open Modal
        </button>
        <button type="button"  data-a11y-dialog-show="my-accessible-dialog1">
            Open Modal2
          </button>
  <p>To see this in action, you just need <button class="link-like" data-a11y-dialog-show="my-accessible-dialog">open the dialog window</button>. Once it’s open, you should not be able to interact with other links on the main page <a href="https://github.com">like going to the main GitHub page.</a> The focus is said to be "trapped" inside the dialog until the user explicitely decides to leave it.</p>

  <p>On top of that, this implementation provides all the usual mandatory bits from a dialog window: correct usage or ARIA landmarks, absolute freedom in regard to the styling, closing when pressing ESC, closing when clicking the background overlay, closing when clicking the close button, a simple yet powerful DOM API, for half a kilobyte of JavaScript. It is fully tested using a headless browser to make sure it works as intended.</p>

    Overlay related notes:
    - It has to have the `tabindex="-1"` attribute.
    - It doesn’t have to have the `data-a11y-dialog-hide` attribute, however this is recommended. It hides the dialog when clicking outside of it.
  -->

  <!--
    Dialog window content related notes:
    - It is the actual visual dialog element.
    - It may have the `alertdialog` role to make it behave like a “modal”. See the “Usage as a modal” section of the docs.
    - It doesn’t have to be a `<dialog>` element, it can be a `<div>` element with the `dialog` or `alertdialog` role (e.g. `<div role="dialog">`).
    - It doesn’t have to have the `aria-labelledby` attribute however this is recommended. It should match the `id` of the dialog title.

      - It does have to have the `type="button"` attribute.
      - It does have to have the `data-a11y-dialog-hide` attribute.

    <p>This is content that lives inside of a dialog box. It's fully accessible which makes our users happy. And because it's inside of a dialog that pops up, it makes our designers and UX people happy as well.</p>

    <p>The focus is already on the close button. This way users do not need to tab again after reading the content in this box. Pushing ESC will also close this dialog.</p>
